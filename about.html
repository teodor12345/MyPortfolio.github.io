        <h5>UX Design</h5>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The UX Beginner course is a great introduction to the latest on UX design approaches and methods that are
             immediately applied to a real client based project within the course. I feel having gone through the experience I am more confident 
             in working with UX teams and communicating ideas within distributed group. We used Figma and Miro for the first time and these were fundamental tools during the project 
            - I loved the learning process that was integrated with a live project and great value for money</p>

        <h3>Udemy Front-end "50 projects in 50 days"</h3>
        <h5>Front-End Development</h5>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The main objective of studying the course is to create 50 small projects including HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript in 50 days (intended to be one per day), 
            and in every project, you apply theory to practice.
             What it was interesting to me is that all of the projects are intended to be components, I mean, that you can use that piece of code to include it on a big project,
             because they are features that you find in most of the websites on the internet
             After creating the habit of doing one project per day, I became more excited about it, because, in every project, you apply something new. 
             I had never coded with DOM manipulation, that's the point where you start to like JavaScript,
              manipulating things on your website is when everything you've learned about loops, variables, objects, arrays, and so on makes more sense..</p>
